      <h2>Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Kimbap (from gim, a type of seaweed, and bap, the Korean term for
        "rice") is easy, portable, and adaptable to any palate, diet, or
        occasion. These rolls are usually eaten at picnics, and while delicious
        eaten right when prepared, they hold their shape and flavor well when
        eaten cold. Don't let them sit too long in the fridge before eating,
        though—the texture will change, the seaweed will get soggy, and the roll
        will lose its bite.

        <h3>Prepare the Rice and Vegetables</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather the ingredients.
          </li>
          <img src="/images/kimbap01.webp" alt="kimbap ingredients" />
          <li>
            In a mixing bowl, place the warm rice and add the sesame oil and
            salt. Mix well and reserve.
            <img src="/images/kimbap02.webp" alt="a bowl of rice" />
          </li>
          <li>
            In a very hot nonstick skillet, briefly stir-fry the carrot, add a
            dash of salt, and remove from the pan after 2 or 3 minutes. Set
            aside and reserve.
            <img src="/images/kimbap03.webp" alt="stir-fried carrot" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the same hot skillet, stir-fry the cucumber, add a dash of
            salt, and remove from the pan after 2 or 3 minutes. Set aside and
            reserve.
            <img src="/images/kimbap04.webp" alt="stir-fried cucumber" />
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk the eggs in a small bowl. Cook the eggs into a flat omelet in
            the nonstick skillet for 1 minute.

          </li>
          <li>
            Once cooked on one side, carefully flip and cook on the other for an
            extra minute.

          <li>
            Remove the omelet from the pan and cut it into long strips. Set
            aside and reserve.

        <h3>Roll the Kimbap</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Using a bamboo sushi roller or a piece of aluminum foil, lay one
            piece of the dried seaweed shiny side down.<img
              src="/images/kimbap08.webp"
              alt="dried seaweed sheet"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread about 1/2 cup of the cooked rice onto 2/3 of the seaweed,
            leaving the top 1/3 bare. Have a bowl of water nearby when rolling
            for moistening your hands, which will prevent the rice from sticking
            to them and help seal the rolls.<img
              src="/images/kimbap09.webp"
              alt="rice on seaweed sheet"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the rice is flat, lay 2 ounces of the bulgogi down (if using),
            about a third of the way up from the bottom of the seaweed. Place
            the meat in a horizontal strip and keep in mind that if you add too
            much filling, the roll might become too difficult to roll and
            cut.<img
              src="/images/kimbap10.webp"
              alt="rice and meat on seaweed sheet"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 1/4 of each filling: carrot, spinach, cucumber, radishes, egg,
            and imitation crabmeat, if using.<img
              src="/images/kimbap11.webp"
              alt="rice, meat and vegetables on seaweed sheet"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll tightly from the bottom, as if you were rolling a sleeping bag,
            firmly pressing down to make the fillings stay in place.<img
              src="/images/kimbap12.webp"
              alt="rolling the kimbap"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            As you continue to roll, pull the roll down toward the end of the
            bamboo mat. Spread a tiny dab of water along the top seam to hold
            the roll together, and close.
          </li>
          <img
              src="/images/kimbap13.webp"
              alt="seal the kimbap roll with water"
            />
          <li>
            Repeat the assembling process with the remaining dried seaweed
            sheets. Refrigerate the rolls until ready to serve.<img
              src="/images/kimbap14.webp"
              alt="rolled kimbap"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut each roll into 7 to 8 pieces and serve. Enjoy.
