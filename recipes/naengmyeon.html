      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Though many Americans enjoy gazpacho and maybe a cold bowl of
        vichyssoise now and then, soup never really made the roster of popular
        summertime menu items. Naeng myun (or naengmyeon), a Korean cold noodle
        soup with thin, slightly chewy noodles topped with egg, meat,
        vegetables, and a vinegar-infused ice-cold broth, could be the
        game-changer.

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the noodles and rinse them well in cold water to stop the
          cooking process and eliminate any excess starch.<br /><img

        </li>
        <li>
          Pour a generous amount of chilled broth over the noodles to cover
          them, then add a few ice cubes to the bowl.<br /><img

        <li>
          Place half a boiled egg, some cucumber and pear slices, pickled
          radish, and a few brisket slices on top of the noodles. Serve with
          Korean mustard paste, sugar, and vinegar on the side.<br /><img
